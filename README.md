# SNLO Helper

Utilises SNLO software for simulation of nonlinear processes in crystals.

An autoclicker clicks different buttons/fills fields in order to automate SNLO simulations.

Beware, that the script does its work with your mouse and keyboard, so you should not interact with the computer in the meanwhile.
The autoclicker can be interrupted by moving the mouse into the top right corner of the screen.


## Installation

Install all the requirements in requirements.txt, for example with pip via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (in this folder).


## Usage

- You can execute `snlohelper.py` in a console, which imports all the methods and sets the screen resolution factor.
- Alternatively, you can import methods from `snlohelper`. In this case you have to set the screen resolution with `set_screenfactors()` yourself.

Use the methods as conventient.
