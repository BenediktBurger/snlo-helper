# SNLO Helper

Utilises SNLO software for simulation of nonlinear processes in crystals.

An autoclicker clicks different buttons/fills fields in order to automate SNLO simulations.

Beware, that the script does its work with your mouse and keyboard, so you should not interact with the computer in the meanwhile.
The autoclicker can be interrupted by moving the mouse into the top right corner of the screen.


## Installation

Install it in this folder via `pip install -e .` or via `pip install git+https://git.rwth-aachen.de/nloqo/snlo-helper.git` to download it in the background and install it.


## Usage

- You can execute `snlohelper.py` in a console, which imports all the methods and sets the screen resolution factor.
- Alternatively, you can import methods from `snlohelper`. In this case you have to set the screen resolution with `set_screenfactors()` yourself.

Use the methods as convenient.
